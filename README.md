# Job Search Roguelike

*A text-based roguelike that turns job search trauma into gameplay*

## 🎮 The Experience

- Every run is different: randomized jobs, recruiter moods, surprise bills.

- Win by landing the dream job; lose by eviction, burnout, or giving up.

- This is V0: intentionally raw, balance is spicy.

## 🚀 How to Play
**Python Version:**
Run: `python job_search_roguelike_V01.py`

Windows EXE: Available on itch.io - no installation needed!


This is the first playable prototype of Job Search Roguelike. It’s intentionally rough but fully playable — the goal is to land the dream job before you run out of resources.

1. Start your run

Enter your name (or press Enter to use the default).

You begin with:

Energy 💤: how much effort you can spend.

Money 💸: used for training and paying bills.

Confidence 💡: drops when you get rejected, rises with wins.

Skills 📚: start with one.

Leads 🧑‍🤝‍🧑: networking potential.

2. Each week, choose an action

1) Apply → sends out an application. May lead to interview → job → dream job (win!) or rejection (confidence loss).

2) Network → meet people, gain leads, sometimes boost or lose confidence.

3) Train → spend money to add a new skill. Increases confidence, helps with callbacks.

4) Rest → recover energy, small confidence boost.

3. Pay bills

Every 4 weeks, $1000 is deducted automatically. If you can’t keep up, eviction looms.

4. End conditions

Win 🏆: Land a dream job (high salary offer).

Lose ❌:

Money ≤ −100 → Evicted.

Energy ≤ 0 → Burnout.

Confidence ≤ 0 → Gave up.

👉 Tip: If you only Apply, you’ll burn out or go broke fast. Balance Training, Networking, and Rest to survive long enough for the right opportunity.
